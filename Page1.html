<h3>Chapter 1: Ara ara?</h3>
<p>Today's class is another boring day desu ne~<br/>
    I heard new students are coming in after this period, so let's mull over our HTML CSS basics!<br/>
    So I broke the lines with br/> and h1/2/3/4/5/6> is used for word size. hr/> is the line up there!<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; (& nbsp let's me spacebar/my spacebar works tho)<br/>
</p>
<p style="color:red";>"Hey, Y/N, still going over your basics? You'll fail at this rate, you know~</p>
<p>"Darrion onii-chan!, I'm sorry... but how did you write your line to be red?</p>
<p style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)";>"hmph, you don't even know this much? I used inline CSS, by including style="color:red" at the first statement!It's also possible to state your rgb values instead of red."</p>
<pre>"Ehehe.. I'm sorry Onii-chan, always depending on you like this..
    ah, but I know how to use &#60;/pre> ! HTML is my specialty desu yo~~
    I can even write a list of my class mates like this! or I can use &#60;/ol> or &#60;/ul> depending on if I want order.
    I can show you! &#60;b> is bold and &#60;i> is italic! and I just learned & lt can put &#60; symbol!
    & provide tons of symbols, so I'm hoping to use them more... desu.
</pre>
<img src="bry" width="300px" height="300px" alt="Bryan">
<p style="color:red";>"Your pre has a weird font... I wonder if thats normal.. Who tf is Bryan? Sigh.. at least you named the alt..."</p>
<p style="color:red";>"Y/N, don't forget to include the ID of everyone next time. External CSS will be much more cleaner and easy to write. I'll smack you silly if you failed. C'mon, class is starting. Let's move."</p>
<p>"Okay, Darrion Onii-chan! Let's meet the new kids today! I think the teacher set up a descriptive list about them!"</p>
<h4>Web Design Class!(bolded might be a potential harem?)</h4>
<ol>
    <li><b>Darrion</b></li>
    <li>Y/N</li>
    <li><b>Sean</b></li>
    <li>Wiz</li>
    <li><b>Kia</b></li>
    </ol>
<p>"So this list was made with &#60;ol> and &#60;li> , li being each element in the list! ol being the ordered list, I heard you can also use ul to get a list without a number! Let's check on the description! I heard there's banner for each~~"</p>

    <dd></dd>
    <dt style="color:rebeccapurple;text-align:center;"></dt>
    <dd></dd>
    <dt style="color:rgb(0, 255, 191);text-align:center;"></dt>

<p><b>"So we have 6 students at this current moment. We will have another 4 students in a few days, I expect all of you to be more mature for this."</b></p>
<p>"Ok~ Hey Teacher, what are we gonna learn today?"</p>
<p><b>"We're in a rush. It's going to be making your own table with Javascript."</b></p>
<p style="color:red";>"Nani! Isn't that too complicated!!! I don't even know how to write a table!!!"</p>
<p><b>We'll go over it now. inside the &lt;table> element, there will be &lt;tr> being table row and &lt;td> being data. This is my table of schedule.</b></p>
